# Ship Action

> **Agent:** Load this file when `ship` triggers. Also load `references/quality-gates.md` for gate commands and `references/session-management.md` for resume/stuck detection.

Implement features with a build/review/fix loop. Handles both quick one-shot and iterative spec-driven work.

---

## Mode Detection

```
Active spec in specs/active/?
  YES → LOOP mode (iterate until spec complete)
  NO  → ONE-SHOT mode (create inline spec, implement, validate)
```

## Task Tracking (MANDATORY for mini/standard)

Before starting any implementation, create tasks in your agent's built-in task/todo system. Track what to build AND what to validate.

**Create these tasks at the start of each ship cycle:**
```
[ ] {scope item 1} → AC-{N}
[ ] {scope item 2} → AC-{N}
[ ] ...
[ ] Generate tests for new/changed behavior
[ ] Quick pass: lint + typecheck (changed files)
[ ] Review: run perspectives
[ ] Fix BLOCKING issues
[ ] Full pass: lint (changed) + typecheck (full) + build (full) + test (related)
[ ] Exit check: all Must Have ACs + Error ACs + scope items passing
```

**Bug mode tasks (replace scope items above):**
```
[ ] BASELINE: run full test suite, record results
[ ] RED: write failing regression test
[ ] GREEN: implement fix, verify test passes
[ ] DIFF: run full suite, compare to baseline (zero new failures)
[ ] SCAN: check codebase for sibling bugs
[ ] PREVENT: propose prevention rules (max 2, non-trivial bugs only)
```

Update tasks as you work: mark in-progress when starting, complete when done. One task in-progress at a time.

## Phase 0: Setup

1. **Detect project stack** (monorepo, framework, test runner, linter)
2. **Load active spec** (if LOOP mode) or create inline spec (ONE-SHOT)
3. **Detect resume state** (see session-management.md):
   - FRESH: No prior work — start from beginning
   - RESUMING: Prior progress found — resume from last checkpoint
   - STUCK: Multiple failed iterations — escalate
   - READY_FOR_DONE: All scope complete — suggest `done`

## Spec-First Enforcement

```
Has spec?
  YES → Continue
  NO  → Estimate size
    trivial (<5 LOC)  → Implement directly, no spec
    micro (<30 LOC)   → Create inline comment spec
    mini (<100 LOC)   → Create spec file (minimal)
    standard (100+)   → Create full spec (suggest `plan` first)
    emergency/hotfix   → Skip spec, log reason
```

## Bug Mode Detection

When fixing bugs, classify:

| Type | Signal | Approach |
|------|--------|----------|
| Simple | Clear cause, single file | Anti-cascade TDD (below) |
| Complex | Unclear cause, multiple files, intermittent | Scientific debugging (see patterns/debugging.md) → then anti-cascade TDD |

Complex bugs require scientific debugging FIRST:
1. Symptom capture (exact error, reproduction steps)
2. Hypothesis formation (ranked by likelihood)
3. Evidence collection (binary search, instrumentation)
4. Root cause confirmation
5. Then apply anti-cascade TDD below

### Anti-Cascade TDD Protocol

All bug fixes follow this protocol. Full details: [regression-testing.md](../patterns/regression-testing.md).

```
1. BASELINE → Run full test suite, record pass/fail counts
2. RED      → Write test reproducing the bug (MUST FAIL)
3. GREEN    → Implement fix, verify regression test passes
4. DIFF     → Run full test suite again, compare to baseline
5. BLOCK    → Any NEW failures = fix introduced regressions → roll back, rethink
6. SCAN     → Check codebase for sibling bugs (same pattern)
7. PREVENT  → Propose rules to prevent this class of bug (max 2)
```

**DIFF is the anti-cascade mechanism.** By comparing full suite results before and after, you catch any regression the fix introduces — before it cascades.

**PREVENT is lightweight:** max 2 proposals, inline approval, advisory (not blocking). Covers coding rules, anti-patterns, quality checks only. Skip for trivial bugs and emergencies. Full details: [regression-testing.md](../patterns/regression-testing.md) Step 7.

If fix introduces regressions (DIFF fails):
- Option A: Fix regressions without breaking the original fix
- Option B: Roll back, find a different approach
- Option C: Escalate to user with evidence

**Bug fix ACs (auto-generate if not in spec):**
- AC-B1: GIVEN {reproduction steps} WHEN {trigger} THEN bug no longer occurs
- AC-B2: GIVEN regression test WHEN run against unfixed code THEN test FAILS (RED)
- AC-B3: GIVEN regression test WHEN run against fixed code THEN test PASSES (GREEN)
- AC-B4: GIVEN full test suite WHEN run after fix THEN no NEW failures vs baseline

## ONE-SHOT Flow

For quick fixes and small features without an active spec:

```
1. Analyze scope (files affected, estimated LOC)
2. Create plan (brief, inline)
3. Implement
4. Quality gates (lint → typecheck → build → test)
5. Self-review (re-read all changes)
6. Output summary
```

## LOOP Flow (Ship Loop)

Core iteration algorithm for spec-driven work:

```
iteration = 0
max_iterations = spec.max_iterations OR default_by_size()
stuck_threshold = max(3, max_iterations / 2)

WHILE iteration < max_iterations:
  iteration++

  # 1. BUILD
  Pick next unchecked scope item
  Implement it

  # 1b. TEST GENERATION (after implementation)
  Detect test infra (once per session, cache result)
  If no test infra → propose setup (load references/testing-automation.md)
  Generate unit tests for new/changed functions
  Generate e2e tests for journey-impacting scope items
  Run tests, verify behavior (RED → GREEN)

  Run quick quality pass (lint + typecheck on changed files)
  Mark scope item [x] if passing

  # 2. REVIEW (every 2-3 iterations or on request)
  Run multi-perspective review (see actions/review.md)
  Collect issues: BLOCKING vs WARN

  # 3. FIX
  Fix all BLOCKING issues
  Log WARN issues in spec notes

  # 4. EXIT CHECK
  all_must_have_acs = all Must Have ACs checked [x]
  all_error_acs = all Error Criteria ACs checked [x]
  all_scope_complete = all spec scope items checked [x]
  quality_clean = lint + typecheck + build + test all pass
  no_blockers = no BLOCKING review issues

  IF all_must_have_acs AND all_error_acs AND all_scope_complete
     AND quality_clean AND no_blockers:
    EXIT → clean (suggest `done`)

  # ACs are the source of truth for "is work done?"
  # Scope items track implementation progress.
  # Both must be complete.

  # 5. STUCK DETECTION
  progress = scope_items_completed / total_scope_items
  IF iteration >= stuck_threshold AND progress < 0.5:
    ESCALATE (see Stuck Escalation below)
```

### Default Iterations by Size

| Size | Max Iterations | Stuck Threshold |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| mini | 5 | 3 |
| standard (small) | 8 | 4 |
| standard (medium) | 12 | 6 |
| standard (large) | 20 | 10 |

## Quality Gates (Per Iteration)

**Quick pass** (after each edit batch):
- Lint changed files
- Typecheck changed files

**Full pass** (before exit):
- Lint changed files
- Typecheck full project
- Build full project
- Test related tests

Auto-detect tooling from project files. See `references/quality-gates.md`.

## Stuck Escalation

Three levels, triggered by lack of progress:

| Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Warning | At stuck_threshold, progress < 50% | Log warning, continue |
| Pause | 2 iterations after warning, no progress | Present options to user |
| Hard stop | At max_iterations | Force exit with summary |

**Pause options:**
1. Continue with different approach
2. Reduce scope (cut items)
3. Defer to next session
4. Drop feature entirely

## Bug Encounter Protocol

When a bug is found during implementation:

```
1. Log bug in spec under "## Encountered Bugs"
   Format: BUG-{N}: {summary} | Status: Investigating/Fixed/Deferred
2. Classify: blocks current scope item? (Y/N)
3. If blocking: fix immediately, add regression test
4. If non-blocking: defer, continue with scope
5. All bugs must be Fixed or Deferred before `done`
```

## Review Integration

Review runs automatically during ship loop. Perspectives:

**Core (always):** Correctness, Security, Reliability, Performance, DX
**Conditional:** Scalability, Observability, Testability, Accessibility

See `actions/review.md` for full perspective details.

## Progress Tracking

Update spec after each iteration:

```markdown
## Progress
| Item | Status | Iteration |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Scope item 1 | [x] Complete | 2 |
| Scope item 2 | [~] In progress | 3 |
| Scope item 3 | [ ] Pending | - |
```

## Output

Follow the output template in `references/templates/ship-output.md`.

Covers: iteration output, 4 exit states (clean/partial/stuck/hard stop), spec mutation output.

Exit states:

| State | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| Clean | All Must Have + Error ACs pass, all scope done, gates green, no blockers |
| Partial | Scope done but ACs failing |
| Stuck | Hit stuck threshold, user chose to stop |
| Hard stop | Hit max iterations |

## Risk Flag System

After each implementation step, assess risk level of changes:

```
For each changed file, check:
  Auth/security logic?        → HIGH
  DB schema/migration?        → HIGH
  Payment/billing?            → HIGH
  Public API contract?        → HIGH
  Delete/destructive op?      → HIGH
  Config/environment?         → MEDIUM
  New dependency?             → MEDIUM
  Performance-critical path?  → MEDIUM
  Internal refactor?          → LOW
  Tests/docs only?            → LOW

  Highest risk across all changes = overall risk
```

| Risk | Action |
|------|--------|
| LOW | Continue autonomously |
| MEDIUM | Note in spec, mention in self-review |
| HIGH | **PAUSE.** Present to user: what changed, what could go wrong, recommendation. User approves before continuing. |

Configurable by editing this file directly.

## Production Validation

Concrete checks for production deploys. Run these in addition to standard gates.

```
Auto-detect and run (if tooling exists):

1. Dependency vulnerability scan
   npm audit / pnpm audit / yarn audit / pip-audit / cargo audit
   Level: BLOCKING (critical/high), ADVISORY (moderate/low)

2. Security scan
   Check for: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection patterns,
   XSS vectors, open redirects, insecure dependencies
   Level: BLOCKING

3. Build verification
   Full production build (not dev build)
   Command: {framework build command} with production flags
   Level: BLOCKING

4. Smoke test (if test infrastructure supports it)
   Start server, hit health endpoint, verify response
   Level: ADVISORY

5. Bundle/artifact size check
   Compare to previous build if baseline exists
   Level: ADVISORY (warn if >20% increase)

6. Schema validation (if schema files changed)
   Verify migration is reversible
   Check for breaking changes in API contracts
   Level: BLOCKING
```

## Intent Auto-Detection

No flags needed. The agent detects intent from natural language:

| User Says | Agent Does |
|-----------|-----------|
| "emergency fix", "hotfix" | Skip spec ceremony |
| "skip tests", "don't run tests" | Skip test gate (log reason) |
| "skip review" | Skip review perspectives |
| "deploy to production", "production ready" | Run production validation |
| "force it", "proceed anyway" | Proceed past CONDITIONAL readiness |

Always document any skipped gates in output.

## Parallel Execution

When scope items are independent (no shared files), they can be implemented in parallel if your agent supports multi-tool or concurrent execution.

```
Check: Do scope items share files in Codebase Impact?
  NO shared files → parallelizable (implement simultaneously)
  YES shared files → sequential (implement in order)

Parallel rules:
  - Each parallel item gets its own quick pass
  - Merge results before running full pass
  - If parallel items conflict at merge → resolve, re-run quick pass
  - Review runs once after all parallel items complete
```

## Spec Mutation Protocol (Mid-Loop Changes)

When user requests scope changes during the ship loop:

```
User: "also add X" / "change Y to Z" / "remove W"
  │
  ├─ 1. PAUSE current implementation
  ├─ 2. UPDATE SPEC FILE:
  │     - Add/modify/remove scope items
  │     - Add/modify acceptance criteria (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
  │     - Update user journey if flow changes
  │     - Re-run traceability check (scope ↔ AC, no orphans)
  │     - Update Progress section
  ├─ 3. UPDATE TASKS: create new, delete obsolete
  ├─ 4. RE-ASSESS: does change affect tier, iteration limit, or risk?
  ├─ 5. RESUME ship loop with updated scope
  │
  └─ RULE: Never implement untracked work.
           If it's not in the spec, update the spec first.
```

The spec is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. It must reflect reality at all times.

## Never

- Never runs `git push`
- Never runs deploy commands
- Never makes production changes
- Never runs destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `push --force`)
